# Roman Emperor App

Name: Roman Emperor App 

Description: This Roman Emperor application is my Flatiron School Phase 2 Project.  This single page application was built using React.  The application provides information on 5 very influential Roman Emperors.  This application incorporates client-side routing.  This means that the components are separated into different pages and the user can easily flip between different displays of information while still maintaining a single page application.  The main home page allows the user to select one of the Roman Emperors and they are routed to the specific Emperor Profile.  The Emperor Profile component renders the specific Emperor information (name, reign, info, image)  Users also have the ability to click on the Emperor Form route, which will route them to a page where they can input a new Roman Emperor with the required information inputs (name, reign, image, info).  The emperor backend information is located in a db.json file.  The application includes an About route, where the user can learn more about the position of a Roman Emperor.  The 

I faced some challenges with putting the components together and getting the client-side routing to function correctly.

Prerequisites: This application requires the following installation into your terminal:  npm install react-router-dom@6.  
It also requires npm install and npm start of the app from one terminal, and another terminal is need to do the npm run server to extract information from the db.json file.
