# Roman Emperor App

Name: Roman Emperor App 

Description: This application is my Phase 2 Project with Flatiron School.  This React application provides information on 5 very influential Roman Emperors who I selected from internet sources.  The app is a single-page application that utilizes client-side routing.  This means that each component is separated onto different pages with their own.  The app provides the a review of the 5 emperors on the Emperor Profile tab.  You need to select the specific emperor link you want to access on the home page.  Then you will be routed to the Emperor Profile component, which renders the specific Emperor information.  Users also have the ability to click on the Emperor Form route, which will route them to a page where they can input a new Roman Emperor with the required information inputs (name, reign, image, info).  The Home Page displays the main page and the links provided that route to the Emperor Profile's.  The emperor information is located in a db.json file.  

I faced some challenges with putting the components together and getting the client-side routing to function correctly.

Prerequisites: This application requires the following installation into your terminal:  npm install react-router-dom@6.  
It also requires npm install and npm start of the app from one terminal, and another terminal is need to do the npm run server to extract information from the db.json file.
